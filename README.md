# Waves in Portugal vs. Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean

## Project Description
In the ocean waves arise due to storms (e.g. hurricanes), and can be measure with buoys floating at the surface. In the present project I try to find a correlation between waves height in the Portuguese coast with hurricanes happening in the Atlantic Ocean (see report.pdf)

## Contents
Inside the folder "waves-portugal-hurricanes-atlantic" you will find:
- code
	- font.ipynb: some code I had to implement in order to be able to plot the arrows for the waves graphs.
	- huricanes_analysis.ipynb
	- waves_analysis.ipynb: here I basically change the name of the file loaded depending on which wave I wanted to work on.
- data_sets
	- atlantic_Tsunami source events.csv (source: kaggle)
	- FLE0114.TXT & FLE0214.TXT: these are just two example files from the portuguese buoy data (the data I was given with I was not allowed to share). Each file represents a month (FLEMMYY, M for month, Y for year). In the waves_analysis.ipynb, the first cell, in comment, explains what is each columns in these FLEMMYY.TXT files (source: Hydrographic Institute, Portuguese Agency for Environment (APA)).
